# Features TODO

1. Add support for tamil bible like English. Tamil bible is available in all formats whichever you like to use (https://github.com/godlytalias/Bible-Database/tree/master/Tamil)
2. Add support to import sermon text files to search like how we search the bible. That would be really helpful. (For example, import spurgeon sermon text files, import John Bunyan sermons files, import Calvin Sermon files)
3. Add support to Sync or Pull sermon text files from website folder link or shared folder link. That would be really helpful. (For example, spurgeon sermon text files placed in a website in a folder, John Bunyan sermons files placed in a website in a folder, import Calvin Sermon files placed in a website in a folder)
